## Values

* I value **efficiency**. Early in my career someone once told me "we can always find money, but we have limited time".
* I try to be as productive as I can be with my time but as I get older I have learned to value **work-life** balance. I wish I had done this earlier.
* **Discovery** and **self-learning** are important to me. I'm most happy reading, exploring, and experimenting.
* A **sense of urgency** and follow-through is important to me in myself and others.
* As I get older and deeper into my career I aspire to be a **mentor** to others.
* **communication** is important to me. I strive to be as succinct as possible and always trying find ways to explain complex topics.
* I love the feeling of being in the "**flow**" with my work. Momentum is important to me and I look for ways to generate it and keep it going.

## Personality

* I am **pragmatic**. I will prioritize an approach that delivers value incrementally.
* I like to have **fun** with the work I'm doing and the people I'm working with. I keep a large collection of memes that I am ready to deploy at any moment.
* I can be **impatient** due to my focus on efficiency. I'm working on this.
* I do not like **conflict** and often try to avoid it. This rarely leads to good outcomes though so I'm working on developing better ways to engage and resolve issues early.
* I will take **command** in stressful situations. I have always worked in 24/7 online internet businesses and seen crazy outages and massive DDoS attacks. They have taught me that you will be OK and it's never as bad as you think it is in the moment.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?

* I have taken [the test](https://www.5lovelanguages.com/) and my love language is **words of affirmation**. However I dispute this and assert that my true love language is gifts. I appreciate recognition for a job well done, but if you're my employer I prefer monetary gifts.
* I prefer to receive negative feedback in private 1-1's. Please ask me first, I may need a moment to take a breath.

## Work Patterns

What hours do you usually work?

* I wake up around 6am PT and work for an hour or two before going to the gym or running. I'm back and working by 9:30 PT and then in the office by 10am PT
* I try to maintain a consistent **work from home** day on Wednesdays.
* I am trying to wrap up my work day around 5-6pm PT and then pursue non-work things.
* Because I've made my hobby my work I will occasionally work in the evening as well. You can ping me on Slack and I will respond if I'm available. If I feel we have a good rapport I may ping you on Slack after hours as well, especially if I'm excited by something I'm working on, but I never ever expect anyone to be working after-hours so don't feel obligated to respond.

When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups?

* Planning and making TODO lists as a **group** is my ideal.
* I am not good at pair programming but I enjoy pairing up at the early stage of **planning** and discussing **approaches** to solving a problem. After we have an idea on how to tackle the problem and have created a list of work I prefer to divide the work and work individually.
* I generally learn best **alone** where I am free to move at my own pace.

How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?

* I tend to have a lot of energy in the **mornings**.
* I think my energy level stays fairly constant throughout the day. (exception: if I overate at lunch I'll probably be drained for a couple hours)
* Pair-programming and talking for many hours drains me. If I spend a day pairing I will be completely drained by 3-4pm.

## Communication Preferences

* I prefer you contact me on **Slack**.
* I declared **email bankruptcy** several years ago. Email is not the best way to contact me. I do not have a consistent pattern for when I read email but it is generally only once or twice per day.
* If I'm in the office with headphones on and it looks like I'm really into what I'm listening to it probably means I've found **momentum**. Please ping me on Slack.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

* When I become **pedantic** I have likely become emotional and tunnel-visioned on something unimportant.

### How to help

* I just need time to step back and think. I usually realize I am being unreasonable but it takes time.

## Me Being Me

* My style of humor is often **sarcastic**. This can come off as negative when I don't intend it to be, especially when this happens on text-based mediums like Slack.

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

* I have a low tolerance for **pedancy**. This is a quality I sometimes engage in myself and always regret it.
* I do not like when engineers' jump to a conclusion about a system or past decisions that they have not taken the time to understand or empathize with.
* I do not like when people are negative about other engineers, eg: "what the hell were those idiots thinking?"
* Meetings without outcomes / decisions.
* Programming language zealots.

## Ask Me About

* Containers - cgroups, seccomp, Docker, Kubernetes, whatever!
* PKI / TLS. Early in my career I was fortunate enough to work on building a public CA. This exposed me to some interesting nerdy stuff.
* My [dotfiles](https://github.com/joemiller/dotfiles) or my editor setup (NeoVim and VSCode). I'm obsessed with my making work environment efficient.
* Wine / Beer / Cocktails. I'm not an expert but I'll happily chat about them.
* The "SEE" method for technical writing.
* Politics, current events. I read a lot of news and was a history major for a short time.
